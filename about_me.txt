My name is Halima Muhammad Idris. I am currently a 400 level student at University of Abuja studying veterinary medicine. I love medicine and tech related stuff. Hence my enrollment in this course. My git account will document my growth and hopefully I will read this one day and smile at the journey I would have made. Thanks for reading. Bye.
